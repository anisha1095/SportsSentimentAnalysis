Today he was vital off the bench, not only because of the quality of the finish but he ran at players and brought life to a tiring attack. Strength. In. Depth. #WHUMUN",BradJCox_
473,2021-09-19 15:18:01+00:00,1439609732302577670,"With that all being said, you’ve got to be over the moon for both Jesse Lingard and David de Gea today. De Gea had such a rough end to last season - replaced as starting GK and suffered in Europa League penalty shootout - but he is showing signs of being back to his best.",BradJCox_
474,2021-09-19 15:18:00+00:00,1439609729966354437,So important for #MUFC to bounce back today after a miserable midweek in the Champions League. Liverpool also took maximum points and City dropped two. Scoring late increases belief and grows a winning mentality. To win when not playing great is key for any title-chasing side.,BradJCox_
