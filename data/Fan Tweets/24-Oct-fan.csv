573,2021-10-24 15:43:37+00:00,1452299749810491400,2-0 Liverpool. Maguire &amp; Shaw all over the place. This could get so ugly. #MUFC #MUNLIV,BradJCox_
574,2021-10-24 15:41:28+00:00,1452299207029755912,Nothing preventing Liverpool from transitioning from defence to attack so far. They’re cruising past McTominay &amp; Fred and targeting the space out wide. #MUFC #MUNLIV,BradJCox_
575,2021-10-24 15:35:46+00:00,1452297775463510017,United cut open inside five minutes and find themselves behind. Defence nowhere to be seen. Shambolic organisation at the back. #MUFC #MUNLIV,BradJCox_
576,2021-10-24 15:33:42+00:00,1452297256233803787,Huge chance squandered by Fernandes. Blasts it wide. #MUFC,BradJCox_
577,2021-10-24 15:26:51+00:00,1452295532257366018,I guess the only good thing about the away team walking out alone/first is that there are no pre-match cuddles between the two sides. #MUFC,BradJCox_

580,2021-10-24 11:12:59+00:00,1452231644971249666,@Murfy888 Pogba played CDM against Leicester with an ageing Nemanja Matic (who had a good game btw). Just feel as though United can't afford to get caught in a 4-2-4 (like Atalanta) against this excellent Liverpool side.,BradJCox_

583,2021-10-24 11:00:42+00:00,1452228551932059658,"Pogba getting the nod ahead of Rashford would be my reaction to Atalanta in midweek. Zappacosta enjoyed freedom down the right as #MUFC were caught in a 4-2-4 when Rashford, Ronaldo, Fernandes and Greenwood didn't trackback. Pogba provides both attacking and defensive output.",BradJCox_
